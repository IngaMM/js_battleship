BATTLESHIP

By I. Mahle

A project of The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/battleship

Instructions

1. Save all files and subfolders in one folder.
2. Open dist/index.html with a browser.

To run the tests type npm run test.

Discussion
I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS and Javascript with webpack. Testing with jest.

This is a browser implementation of the game ‘Battleship’ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game).
Parts of it were written with the technique of TDD (test-driven-development). DOM related methods are kept separate from other functionalities. One of the players can be the computer which has some intelligence (it tries adjacent slots after getting a ‘hit’). The 2 player option lets users take turns by passing the device back and forth while a ‘pass device’ screen is shown.
