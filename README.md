Discussion
I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS and Javascript with webpack. Testing with jest.

This is a browser implementation of the game ‘Battleship’ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game).
Parts of it were written with the technique of TDD (test-driven-development, to run the tests type npm run test.). DOM related methods are kept separate from other functionalities. OOP is used.
At the beginning of the game each player can position his/her ships with drag and drop and turn them by double-clicking.
One of the players can be the computer which has some intelligence (it tries adjacent slots after getting a ‘hit’). The 2 player option lets users take turns by passing the device back and forth while a ‘pass device’ screen is shown.
