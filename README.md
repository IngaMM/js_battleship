Discussion
I used the following technologies: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Jest.

This is an implementation of the popular game Battleship. Two players can play against each other or one of the players can be the computer. The two-player option lets users take turns by passing the device back and forth while a pass-device-screen is shown. At the beginning of the game each player is asked to position his/her ships with drag and drop. A double-click turns a ship. Then the players take turns to shoot on the enemy gameboard. If the computer is playing it is not too easy to defeat because it has some intelligence, too: it tries adjacent slots after getting a hit in order to search for longer ships. The app is written in Javascript and in parts with the technique of TDD (test-driven development). The module JEST is used for testing. The app is fully responsive and can be viewed on screens of all sizes.
